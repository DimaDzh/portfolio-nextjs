            I am a beginner in front-end development. I was recently completed
            the Front-end "Advanced" course at an A-Level IT school, and gained
            basic skills and experience in development. I am currently actively
            looking for my first commercial experience. I am a quick learner and
            can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great
            developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best
            tool for the job.
